In Angular, dependency injection can be managed at different levels, including root level, element level, and through tokens. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of each:

1. Root Level Injection
Description: When you provide a service at the root level, it is available throughout the entire application. 
This means that a single instance of the service is created and shared across all components.

2. Element Level Injection (Component Level Injection)
Description: When you provide a service at the component level, a new instance of the service is created for that specific 
component and its child components. This means that sibling components will not share the same instance.

3. Token-based Injection
Description: Sometimes you may want to provide a service or a value that doesn't have a concrete class. In such cases, '
you can use injection tokens.
